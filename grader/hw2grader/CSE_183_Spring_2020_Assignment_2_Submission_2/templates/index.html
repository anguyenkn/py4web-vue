                            A lion has been seen roaming the empty science library on campus.
                            The police, noticing the intrusion, approached the lion and asked
                            what was his business there. The lion replied that he was attempting
                            to learn web development, and that he found the programming portions
                            rather interesting, but the task of laying out web page most frustrating.

                            "It is truly disappointing! Great minds, such as Don Knuth and Leslie Lamport,
                            devoted their time to improving the art of typography and the science of
                            optimizing the presentation of content on a page, and then here come like a
                            band of savages these web developers, oblivious to the great work of the past,
                            with this completely inane and baroque language!".

                            He continued, "First they invented a lot of tags. Then they fell out of love
                            for them, and decided it's cooler to do things using the same few tags all
                            over the place, decorating them with yet another language called CSS (the name
                            at least it reminds me of my feeling towards it, for I know latin). So now you
                            need two languages to get one thing accomplished! And the whole thing is so
                            complex that to lay down something with a few columns on a page, you practically
                            need a university degree! And look! It cannot even balance the content on these
                            two colums, for goodness sake!"
                            The police thought it better to leave the lion alone, as he looked quite ready
                            to bite anyone who came close.

                <p class="subtitle is-4">A new, very efficient algorithm enables fast scene rendering</p>

                <p>
                    Ray-tracing is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall into
                    an observer's eyes are retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to reconstruct
                    exactly what the view would have been. This is a daunting process, because when
                    encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the ray tracing must chase the
                    many possible backwards paths of such scattering. Professor de Alfaro recently claimed
                    to have invented a new, far more efficient algorithm, one that works in microseconds
                    regardless of the dimension or complexity of the scene. "There are a few restrictions,"
                    he added, "and for the moment our new technique is applicable only to closed environments
                    in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across any closed surface." The
                    contribution is currently undergoing peer review.
