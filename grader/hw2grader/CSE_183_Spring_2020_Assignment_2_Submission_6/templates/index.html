                        A lion has been seen roaming the empty science library on campus.
                        The police, noticing the intrusion, approached the lion and asked
                        what was his business there. The lion replied that he was
                        attempting to learn web development, and that he found the
                        programming portions rather interesting, but the task of laying
                        out web page most frustrating.

                    of optimizing the presentation of content on a page,
                    and then here come like a band of savages these web developers,
                    oblivious to the great work of the past, with this completely inane

                    "First they invented a lot of tags. Then they fell out of love for them,
                    and decided it's cooler to do things using the same few tags all over the
                    place, decorating them with yet another language called CSS (the name at
                    least it reminds me of my feeling towards it, for I know latin). So now you
                    need two languages to get one thing accomplished! And the whole thing is so
                    complex that to lay down something with a few columns on a page, you
                    practically need a university degree! And look! It cannot even balance the
                    content on these two colums, for goodness sake!"

                    The police thought it better to leave the lion alone, as he looked quite ready to
                    bite anyone who came close.

                    <span class="is-italic">Ray-tracing</span>
                    is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall into an
                    observer's eyes are retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to
                    reconstruct exactly what the view would have been. This is a daunting process,
                    because when encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the ray
                    tracing must chase the many possible backwards paths of such scattering.
                    Professor de Alfaro recently claimed to have invented a new, far more efficient
                    algorithm, one that works in microseconds regardless of the dimension or
                    complexity of the scene.
                    <span class="is-italic"> "There are a few restrictions," </span>
                     he added,
                    <span class="is-italic">"and for the moment our new technique is applicable only to closed
                    environments in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across
                    any closed surface." </span>
                    The contribution is currently undergoing peer review.
