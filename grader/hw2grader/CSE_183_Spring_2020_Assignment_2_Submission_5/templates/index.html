                        A lion has been seen roaming the empty science library on campus.
                        The police, noticing the intrusion, approached the lion and asked
                        what was his business there.The lion replied that he was attempting 
                        to learn web development, and that he found the programming portions
                        rather interesting, but the task of laying out web page most frustrating.

                     "It is truly disappointing! Great minds, such as Don Knuth and Leslie Lamport, 
                devoted their time to improving the art of typography and the science of optimizing
                the presentation of content on a page, and then here come like a band of savages these
                web developers, oblivious to the great work of the past, with this completely inane and 
                baroque language!".

                <p>
                He continued, <span class="is-italic">"First they invented a lot of tags. Then they fell out of love for them, 
                and decided it's cooler to do things using the same few tags all over the place, decorating
                them with yet another language called CSS (the name at least it reminds me of my feeling 
                towards it, for I know latin). So now you need two languages to get one thing accomplished!
                And the whole thing is so complex that to lay down something with a few columns on a page, 
                you practically need a university degree! And look! It cannot even balance the content on 
                these two colums, for goodness sake!"</span> The police thought it better to leave the lion alone,
                as he looked quite ready to bite anyone who came close.

            <p class="subtitle"> A new, very efficient algorithm enables fast scene rendering</p>
            
            <p> 
            <span class="is-italic">Ray-tracing</span> is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall 
            into an observer's eyes are retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to reconstruct
            exactly what the view would have been. This is a daunting process, because when encoutering
            solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the ray tracing must chase the many possible backwards
            paths of such scattering. Professor de Alfaro recently claimed to have invented a new, far more
            efficient algorithm, one that works in microseconds regardless of the dimension or complexity of
            the scene.<span class="is-italic"> "There are a few restrictions," he added, "and for the moment our new technique is 
            applicable only to closed environments in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across
            any closed surface."</span> The contribution is currently undergoing peer review.
